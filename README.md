# jot
`jot` is an easy way to add touch-controlled drawings and text to images in your iOS app.  
Bridgit forked this to add multi-line text.  

_Huge_ **kudos** to [Laura Skelton](https://github.com/lauraskelton) and [IFTT](https://github.com/IFTTT) for the original work and for putting this out there.
